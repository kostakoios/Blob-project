Shared mailboxes present attackers with an easy entry point into organizations and usually have the following inherent problems:. .   Their audit logs may be turned off or may be misconfigured.   Their passwords are built-in and are static since there’s no one to change them.   MFA is usually not an option because there's no user and no license.   They have no clear owner. . Add enabled legacy protocols to the mix  and you’ve got a great recipe for a long standing take-over campaign.,In the admin center  go to the "Users" - "Active users" In the list of user accounts  find the account for the shared mailbox from the Affected list - open their properties pane  and then select "Block this user" - "Save changes". .

 Dismissed,M365,Yahav - Test OAuth,Auditing,Medium,0,0/12,Mailbox Auditing [Exchange],Global mailbox auditing is disabled  and some mailboxes are not set to audit.,Enabling mailbox auditing is crucial for security as it tracks all actions taken in a mailbox. Without it  attackers can access and manipulate mailboxes without detection. If mailbox auditing is not enabled  attackers can exploit this to cover their tracks  making it difficult to trace unauthorized access and actions.. This security check first verifies the global audit configuration of the organization. If global auditing is disabled  it then checks individual mailbox audit settings. According to Microsoft's documentation  when global auditing is enabled  individual mailbox settings are irrelevant.. Note that there could be scenarios where the global audit setting can be bypassed for specific mailboxes. These cases are alerted in the security check named "Mailbox Audit Bypass [Exchange].". For more details  refer to the Microsoft documentation on mailbox auditing.,If this check fails  it means that the global configuration setting for enabling mailbox audit is disabled.

Try to assign them roles where they can complete necessary tasks with the least amount of privilege required.
